# Movie Recommendation Engine
### A  collaborative filtering-based approach for making movie recommendations. 

## How does a recommendation engine operate? 
Ever consider how OTT platforms suggest movies to us? 

Sometimes they inquire about our preferences and combine those with other predictors to make a recommendation. 

Based on this collaborative filtering study, this project provides a scaled-down example of how these recommendation systems operate. 

The prize money dataset from Netflix was used in this analysis. 

The concept is to forecast user ratings for movies that have not yet been given them, and then propose films based on a list of movies that have been arranged in descending order of expected ratings.
